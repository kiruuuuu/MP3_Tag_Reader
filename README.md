# MP3_Tag_Reader
This project is a tool for reading and managing metadata (tags) embedded in MP3 audio files. MP3 tags, also known as ID3 tags, store information about audio files, such as the title, artist, album, genre, year, and more. The MP3 Tag Reader extracts and displays this metadata in an organized and user-friendlyÂ manner.
